### [Creating Your First RESTful Spring Boot Microservice with JPA](http://bit.ly/SpringBootMicroservice)
Turbocharge your back-end Java RESTful API development with Spring Boot and Spring Data technologies. This course is intended for experienced Java developers who want to rapidly build microservices that connect with relational databases via the Java Persistence API (JPA). Here, Mary Ellen Bowman walks you through a step-by-step process for building a microservice with an exposed RESTful API featuring HATEOAS, paging, sorting, and CrudRepository interfaces. Learn about technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST, and Spring Web MVC @RestController, and see how they all come together into smart and elegant solutions. As a wrap-up, Mary Ellen guides developers in choosing between the Spring Data REST and REST controllers when exposing more complex services.
### [Extending, Securing and Dockerizing Spring Boot Microservices](http://bit.ly/AdvancedMicroservices)
Build on the foundational knowledge you have of the Spring framework. Learn how to extend, refine, harden, test, and "dockerize" your Spring Boot microservices, and turn them into production-ready applications. Instructor Mary Ellen Bowman teaches the intermediate skills you need to build professional-grade programs, emphasizing standards for quality, security, persistence, and deployment. She shows how to link to external databases, build secure APIs, use unit and integration testing to uncover application flaws during development, and configure scalable deployment options with Docker containers.
### [Spring:Spring Data](http://bit.ly/SpringData)
Coding to databases—which often involves the use of boilerplate code that's difficult to maintain and debug—can be tedious work. Upgrading applications to a different kind of data storage is similarly challenging, as it usually involves massive code rewrites. Spring Data addresses these issues by abstracting data store interactions into a common repository API and eliminating boilerplate code. In this course, learn how to easily implement JPA-based repositories using Spring Data JPA. Mary Ellen Bowman describes the Spring Data umbrella project, and helps you understand JPA for object-relational mapping. She also covers querying, and dives into other Spring Data Commons features such as QueryDSL and auditing.
